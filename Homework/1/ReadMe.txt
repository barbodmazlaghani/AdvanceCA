Homework Content
This assignment involves designing and implementing a pipeline for a MIPS processor architecture. The tasks are divided into several parts, focusing on different aspects of the pipeline design:

Single-Cycle Pipeline Design:

Tasks:
Implement the MIPS pipeline following a single-cycle design approach.
Develop hazard control and data forwarding mechanisms.
Hazard Control and Data Forwarding:

Develop control and data hazard detection and resolution mechanisms for the pipeline.
Integrate additional registers and buffers as needed to manage pipeline hazards effectively.
Programming Tasks:

Write programs that utilize the designed pipeline to demonstrate the correct handling of hazards and instruction sequencing.
Include tests for both control and data hazards.
